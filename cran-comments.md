## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated DESCRIPTION by removing the word "Ensembled" from title
* Updated README by correcting the URL for the life cycle badge
* Updated helper functions for `consolidate()` to use `inherits()` to identify variable's class instead of `class()`

## Test environments
* local R installation, macOS, R 4.1.2

## R CMD check results

## Getting started with qDatr

qDatr has package related functions that help users set-up packages consistent with the qDatr ecosystem of packages. 
The function `setup_package()`, for example, establishes many of the required files and folder structures for a qDatr-consistent data package. 
It requires that the package name starts with a the letter q as well as that the name of at least one author is declared. 

```
qDatr::setup_package("qStates", "James Hollway")
```

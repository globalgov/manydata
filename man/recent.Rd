\usage{
recent(dates, sep = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dates}{First variable to be used, required.
Can be a character or date variable.}

\item{sep}{Year from which to make a cut-off and return the last century.
By default this is the system date, but can be specified.}
}
\value{
A vector the same length as \code{dates}
}
\description{
Resets the century of (unlikely) future events
}
\details{
This function will use the system date as the cut-off
for identifying past or future events.
It is geared towards numeric dates (i.e. "12") not named dates (i.e. "Dec"),
though these dates should be correctly parsed regardless of order or separator.
It will return any datestamps of "9999-12-31",
which may be interpreted as unknown/future date, as is.
Please note that different types of separators in the same vector,
for example c("2004-12-12","12/12/2004", "12.12.2004"),
may confuse the algorithm.
In other words, this function is built for internally consistent codes.

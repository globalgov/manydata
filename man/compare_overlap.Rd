\title{Compare the overlap between datasets in 'many' datacubes}
\usage{
compare_overlap(datacube, dataset = "all", key = "manyID")
}
\arguments{
\item{datacube}{A datacube from one of the many packages.}

\item{dataset}{A dataset in a datacube from one of the many packages.
By default "all".
That is, all datasets in the datacube are used.}

\item{key}{A variable key to join datasets.
'manyID' by default.}
}
\value{
\code{compare_overlap()} returns a tibble with information about each dataset
and the number of overlapping observations.
}
\description{
Compare the overlap between datasets in 'many' datacubes
}
\details{
\code{compare_overlap()} compares the overlap between "key" observations
in each dataset in a 'many' datacube.

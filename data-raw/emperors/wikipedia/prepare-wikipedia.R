# wikipedia Preparation Script

# This is a template for importing, cleaning, and exporting data
# ready for the qPackage.
# The dataset was improted from:
# https://github.com/zonination/emperors
# It was assembled from the following wikipedia page:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors
# The dataset was imported to the package with the following line:
# qCreate::import_data(dataset = "wikipedia", database = "emperors")
# This also created and opened this preparation script.

# Stage one: Collecting data
wikipedia <- readr::read_csv("data-raw/emperors/wikipedia/emperors.csv")

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'Wikipedia' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.

# First, the dataset contains a notes column about some errors in dates.
wikipedia$notes
# Some of the first few dates are supposed to be negative (BC).
# While for other dates, only the year is accurate...
# However, due to issues in dealing with dates with most R packages,
# these dates became positive or were completed arbitrarly.
# Let's change these back and treat dates with `{messydates}`.

# Get these columns into character to be able to modify them.
wikipedia$birth <- as.character(wikipedia$birth)
wikipedia$death <- as.character(wikipedia$death)
wikipedia$reign.start <- as.character(wikipedia$reign.start)

# by adding a BC to them.

wikipedia$reign.start[1] <- paste0(wikipedia$reign.start[1], " BC")
# Some dates are estimates, while others only the year is correct,
# according to the notes.
# How could we be more specific about that?
# Let's look into how `{messydates}` indicates uncertainty
library(messydates)

# We should assign a "~" to dates which are estimates.

# qData includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make Wikipedia available
# within the qPackage.
qCreate::export_data(wikipedia,  database = "emperors", URL = "https://github.com/zonination/emperors")
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
#Â your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please make sure that you cite any sources appropriately and fill in as
# much detail about the variables etc as possible.

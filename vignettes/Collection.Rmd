## Collecting data 

For data collection and loading with qData, the function `import_data()` creates a data-raw folder into a project or package, copies the raw data into the folder and provides a script to facilitate data loading and data correction using qData. 
The function requires that a name for the dataset (two dimensional data sheet being imported) is declared as well as the name of the issue-domain the dataset belongs which will be used to connect two-dimensional datasets into three-dimensional databases that resembles a data cube.

```
qData::import_data("cow", 'states')
```

\title{Set of data structure exploration functions for users}
\usage{
data_source(pkg, database = NULL, dataset = NULL)

data_contrast(pkg, database = NULL, dataset = NULL)

open_codebook(pkg, database, dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{character string of the many package to report data on.
Required input.}

\item{database}{vector of character strings of the many package to
report data on a specific database in a many package
If NULL, the function returns a summary of all databases in the many package
NULL by default for \code{data_source()} and \code{data_contrast()}.}

\item{dataset}{character string of the many package to
report data on a specific
dataset in a specific database of a many package
If NULL and database is specified, returns database level metadata.
NULL by default for \code{data_source()} and \code{data_contrast()}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the data sources

A list with the desired metadata
to compare various datasets in a many package.

Opens a pdf version of the original codebook of the specified
dataset, if available.
}
\description{
The report family of functions allows users
to quickly get information about and compare several
aspects of  a package in the many packages universe,
and its' databases and datasets.
}
\details{
\code{data_source()} displays names of the database/datasets and
source material of data in a many package.

\code{data_contrast()} displays information about databases
and datasets contained in them.
Namely the number of unique ID's, the percentage of
missing data, the number of observations, the number of variables,
the minimum beginning date and the maximum ending date as well as
the most direct URL to the original dataset.

\code{open_codebook()} opens the original codebook of the specified
dataset to allow users to look up the original coding rules.
Note that no original codebook might exist for certain datasets.
In the latter case, please refer to the
source URL provided with each dataset by running \code{manydata::data_contrast()}
as further information on coding rules available online.

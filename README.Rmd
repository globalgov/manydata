`{manydata}` is the central package in the many packages universe aimed at collecting, connecting, and correcting network data across issue-domains of global governance. To assist users in doing so, `{manydata}` contains functions that enable users to download and manipulate data easily.

## Why manydata?

`{manydata}` offers users access to all of the tested data in the various 'many packages' available,
for use in analyses of global governance and beyond.
A special feature of the 'many packages' is that it is not 'opinionated' - instead of
offering a single, supposedly authoritative version of global governance events,
the packages in the many packages universe gather well-regarded datasets in each issue-domain
into three-dimensional 'datacubes'.
The chief advantage of this for global governance researchers is that it enables
a quick and easy way to check the robustness of their results using different formulations of
the study population or concept specification.
The 'datacube' structure has a specific coding system for the variables across the datasets. 
For more details, please see the [vignette](https://globalgov.github.io/manydata/articles/user.html).

## Downloading and installing manydata

The easiest way to install `{manydata}` is directly from CRAN.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("manydata")
```

The development version of the package `{manydata}` can also be downloaded from GitHub. 

```{r git, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("globalgov/manydata")
```

## Available 'many packages'

`{manydata}` connects users to other packages that help fill global governance researchers' data needs.
The `get_packages()` function can be used to discover the 'many packages' currently available.

```{r get, eval=FALSE}
library(manydata)
get_packages()
```

Please see [the website](https://globalgov.github.io/manydata/) for more information about how to use `{manydata}`.
